# Perfect Number:
## A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
### For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

## Problem Solution: 
- Take in an integer and store it in a variable.
- Initialize a variable to count the sum of the proper divisors to 0.
- Use a for loop and an if statement to add the proper divisors of the integer to the sum variable.
- Check if the sum of the proper
